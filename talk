My Thinking About Lambda and Functional Programming

I think the people in this room are more or less heard about the concepts of functional programming

hands up who knows 'Functional Programming'

Although this is a very very technical talk, I hope every one in this room can benefit from my talk.

So before start I want to mention that functional programming is a 'programming paradiam'

And this is I think how this topic is related to every one.

For Commoncode as a technology driven company, we know more and more new start ups and
technology giant in the market choose to use 'Functional' programming lanaguage such as
'Scala, Clojure, Elixir' for backend lanaguage of Ruby and Python, or Nodejs.

For recuriters, I think for you more want to know, when you have
a candidates list 'Functional Programming' in his/her CV, what does it mean? It is a positive sign,
and why functional programmers are tend to think 'too much'.

For commoncoders.
If you want to write good modern JS code, functional programming pretty much a must.
No matter what lanaguage you use, Python ... PHP, understand the ideas of functional
programming.

For Designers, and business analyst.
Sorry basically you can not learn any thing really meaningful, may be some philosophies
I just want to mention from a programmers view, I see the idea of Atomic design in design
is very close the idea of functional programming in programming world.


First thing first functional programming is not just about writing functions,
the function in functional programming refers to a 'mathmatical' function that every one
learns in their which it always return 

Functional programming and its opposite side precedural programming

functional programming is just about writing function
